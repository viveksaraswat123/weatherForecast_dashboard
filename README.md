**Weather & Air Quality Dashboard – Power BI**

This project is a simple yet informative weather and air quality dashboard I built using Power BI. It covers three Indian cities: Ajmer, Hyderabad, and Lucknow.

The idea was to present live weather data (temperature, wind, humidity, UV index, etc.) alongside air quality metrics like PM10, PM2.5, CO, and others — all in a clean, easy-to-read format.

The dashboard includes:
- A 7-day weather forecast visualized using a line chart
- City switcher buttons to dynamically update the view
- An AQI gauge and pollutant breakdown
- Sunrise and sunset timings
- Rain prediction bars
- Other useful metrics like pressure, visibility, and UV index

I focused on keeping the UI modern and dark-themed for better visual clarity. All visuals and data points change based on the city selected.

Inside this repository:
- `weather_dashboard.pbix` – The Power BI file
- `screenshots/` – A few static images of the dashboard (for quick preview)
- `weather_forecast_dashborad.pdf` – A presentation-style export of the dashboard

**Sample Dashboard**

To use it:
1. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop
2. Replace the data source if you're using your own weather API
3. Use the slicer buttons in the top section to switch between cities
4. Feel free to customize or add more cities

This was a fun side project to sharpen my Power BI and DAX skills, and also experiment with building a visually appealing, real-world dashboard.
